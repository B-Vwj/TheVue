Institutions structure politics (Institution Principle); All politics is collective actions (Collective-action Principle); Political outcomes are the product of individual preferences \u0026amp; institutional procedures (Policy Principle); How we got here matters!

	"content": " Notes: Terms Polynomial function(s): a polynomial function of degree n is a function of the form\u0026hellip;  P(x) = a(n)x(n) + a(n-1)x(n-1) + \u0026hellip; + a1x + a0  where n is a nonnegative integer and an =/= 0\nLeading Term: of a polynomial is the term with the highest exponent.\nZeros of a polynomial: P(x) are numbers c, such that P\u0026copy; = 0 - \u0026ldquo;x coordinates of the x-intercepts.\u0026rdquo;\nThe end behavior of a polynomial: For the graph of any polynomial function, the ends will either point up or down. For example:\nAs x -\u0026gt; ∞; f(x) (will either) -\u0026gt; ∞ OR -∞ As x -\u0026gt; -∞; f(x) (will either) -\u0026gt; ∞ OR -∞  Odd Degree \u0026amp; Positive Leading Coefficient: Left down \u0026amp; Right up.\nEven Degree \u0026amp; Positive Leading Coefficient: Both ends up.\nOdd Degree \u0026amp; Negative Leading Coefficient: Left up \u0026amp; Right Down.\nEven Degree \u0026amp; Negative Leading Coefficient: Both ends down.\nOther Things To Remember:  The numbers a0, a1, a2, \u0026hellip;, a(n)  are called coefficients of the Polynomial.\n a0 is the constant coefficient or constant term.\n The number a(n), the coefficient of the highest power, is the leading coefficient, and the term a(x)x(n) is the leading term.\n  Names of certain degrees  If a polynomial consists of just a single term, then it\u0026rsquo;s called a monomial. For example:  P(x) = x3 and Q(x) = -6x5 are monomials.\n f(x) = a(1)x +/- a0 is considered a \u0026ldquo;Linear\u0026rdquo; equation.\n f(x) = a(2)x2 +/- a(1)x +/- a0 is considered a \u0026ldquo;Quadratic\u0026rdquo; equation.\n f(x) = a(3)x3 + a(2)x2 + a(1)x + a0 is considered a \u0026ldquo;Cubic\u0026rdquo; equation.\n  Exponents affect the graph! Even exponent: - Parabola - Bigger exponent means flatter base (near zero)(?) Odd exponent: - Zig-Zag(?) - Bigger exponent means flatter base (near zero)(?)\n"

We\u0026rsquo;ll use Maven instead!   What is Maven? Maven: Build Independency Management Tool\nLets you declare all the dependencies you want in a single file. - No more needing to download the JARs and adding it into the CLASSPATH. - Rather, you mention what JARs you need into the file pom.xml. - pom.xml contains a list of all your dependencies that Maven needs to know/to get - After running a Maven cmd, Maven will check what dependencies are needed for the app, and will get the JARs from a Repository.\nIn short: 1. When needing dependencies, we create the pom.xml file. 1. Add a list of dependencies onto the pom.xml file. 1. Then run a Maven cmd.\nExtras Maven also lets you create a starter project. (no need to create this individual files yourself) - Comes with an \u0026lsquo;Archtype\u0026rsquo; (basically a template) which lets you start a simple project. - In other words, Maven basically creates files, including the pom.xml file for you to begin listing dependencies you need.\n"
