Due to Coronavirus, campus is closed, and the rest of semester is now online, here is the schedule for les Mathematics:\nDear Math 1180 students, First of all, let me say that this is going to be fine. I have the following revised schedule for what we will be doing for the rest of the term. Some explanations are below. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + Alternate Schedule for Math 1180: + +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Monday, March 23: - Test 3 over chapter 5 and sections 6.1,6.2,6.3 will be posted Monday, March 30: - Test 3 is Due - Start Section 6.4 Wednesday, April 1: - Section 6.5 Friday, April 3: - Section 7.1 Monday, April 6: - Work from sections 6.4, 6.5, 7.1 is due - Section 7.2 Wednesday, April 8 - Section 7.3 Friday, April 10 - Section 7.4 Monday, April 13 - Section 7.5 Wednesday, April 15 - Get Test 4 Friday, April 17 - Test 4 is due - Start Section 10.1 Monday, April 20 - Section 10.2 Wednesday, April 22 - Section 10.3 Friday, April 24 - Section 10.4 Monday, April 27 - Work from sections 10.1 – 10.4 is due Wednesday, April 29 - Get test 5 Friday, May 1 - Test 5 is due Monday, May 4 - Get the final exam Friday, May 8 - Final Exam is due  Tests:  You will be testing at home. I will post the test on D2L and attach it to an email. If you have a printer at home you can print the test and work it as you would in class.\nThen you can send me what you have done by either scanning or email. I will be grading you on the completeness, correctness, and clarity of your work and I’ll be a bit merciless about this. You’ll get your first test on March 23 and it will be due on March 30. If you don’t have a printer you can just write the problems on separate paper and send those to me.\nHomework:  I don’t think I’m going to be able to look at all of the homework.\nI can’t think of a good way to get it from you. I will just make extra sure that the tests reflect the homework.\nLecture:  Our regular classroom is a classroom-capture room. That means there is a camera in the room that will record everything that happens there. I’ve asked that the camera be turned on so that you can access the recordings of those lecture whenever you want. I’ll be lecturing to an empty classroom, which will be thrilling for me, but you’ll be able to see it from home. There will be a link in D2L to get to the recording. I’ll keep doing that as long as I can have access to the room. If at some point I no longer have access, I will replace these lectures with some YouTube videos that I will make as well as lots of written explanations of what we are doing.\nGroup-work:  Of course you’re not going to be able to work in groups and still maintain social distancing. I will, however, ask you to do some work in groups of one (that’s by yourself) and send that to me.\nThere will be more information coming soon. Stay tuned. If you have any questions at all you can email me as often as you like.\n"

Maven: Build Independency Management Tool\nLets you declare all the dependencies you want in a single file. - No more needing to download the JARs and adding it into the CLASSPATH. - Rather, you mention what JARs you need into the file pom.xml. - pom.xml contains a list of all your dependencies that Maven needs to know/to get - After running a Maven cmd, Maven will check what dependencies are needed for the app, and will get the JARs from a Repository.\nIn short: 1. When needing dependencies, we create the pom.xml file. 1. Add a list of dependencies onto the pom.xml file. 1. Then run a Maven cmd.\nExtras Maven also lets you create a starter project. (no need to create this individual files yourself) - Comes with an \u0026lsquo;Archtype\u0026rsquo; (basically a template) which lets you start a simple project. - In other words, Maven basically creates files, including the pom.xml file for you to begin listing dependencies you need.\n"
