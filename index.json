Due to Coronavirus, campus is closed, and the rest of semester is now online, here is the schedule for les Mathematics:\nDear Math 1180 students, First of all, let me say that this is going to be fine. I have the following revised schedule for what we will be doing for the rest of the term. Some explanations are below. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + Alternate Schedule for Math 1180: + +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Monday, March 23: - Test 3 over chapter 5 and sections 6.1,6.2,6.3 will be posted Monday, March 30: - Test 3 is Due - Start Section 6.4 Wednesday, April 1: - Section 6.5 Friday, April 3: - Section 7.1 Monday, April 6: - Work from sections 6.4, 6.5, 7.1 is due - Section 7.2 Wednesday, April 8 - Section 7.3 Friday, April 10 - Section 7.4 Monday, April 13 - Section 7.5 Wednesday, April 15 - Get Test 4 Friday, April 17 - Test 4 is due - Start Section 10.1 Monday, April 20 - Section 10.2 Wednesday, April 22 - Section 10.3 Friday, April 24 - Section 10.4 Monday, April 27 - Work from sections 10.1 â€“ 10.4 is due Wednesday, April 29 - Get test 5 Friday, May 1 - Test 5 is due Monday, May 4 - Get the final exam Friday, May 8 - Final Exam is due  Tests:  You will be testing at home. I will post the test on D2L and attach it to an email. If you have a printer at home you can print the test and work it as you would in class.\nThen you can send me what you have done by either scanning or email. I will be grading you on the completeness, correctness, and clarity of your work and Iâ€™ll be a bit merciless about this. Youâ€™ll get your first test on March 23 and it will be due on March 30. If you donâ€™t have a printer you can just write the problems on separate paper and send those to me.\nHomework:  I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to be able to look at all of the homework.\nI canâ€™t think of a good way to get it from you. I will just make extra sure that the tests reflect the homework.\nLecture:  Our regular classroom is a classroom-capture room. That means there is a camera in the room that will record everything that happens there. Iâ€™ve asked that the camera be turned on so that you can access the recordings of those lecture whenever you want. Iâ€™ll be lecturing to an empty classroom, which will be thrilling for me, but youâ€™ll be able to see it from home. There will be a link in D2L to get to the recording. Iâ€™ll keep doing that as long as I can have access to the room. If at some point I no longer have access, I will replace these lectures with some YouTube videos that I will make as well as lots of written explanations of what we are doing.\nGroup-work:  Of course youâ€™re not going to be able to work in groups and still maintain social distancing. I will, however, ask you to do some work in groups of one (thatâ€™s by yourself) and send that to me.\nThere will be more information coming soon. Stay tuned. If you have any questions at all you can email me as often as you like.\n"

Maven: Build Independency Management Tool\nLets you declare all the dependencies you want in a single file. - No more needing to download the JARs and adding it into the CLASSPATH. - Rather, you mention what JARs you need into the file pom.xml. - pom.xml contains a list of all your dependencies that Maven needs to know/to get - After running a Maven cmd, Maven will check what dependencies are needed for the app, and will get the JARs from a Repository.\nIn short: 1. When needing dependencies, we create the pom.xml file. 1. Add a list of dependencies onto the pom.xml file. 1. Then run a Maven cmd.\nExtras Maven also lets you create a starter project. (no need to create this individual files yourself) - Comes with an \u0026lsquo;Archtype\u0026rsquo; (basically a template) which lets you start a simple project. - In other words, Maven basically creates files, including the pom.xml file for you to begin listing dependencies you need.\n"
