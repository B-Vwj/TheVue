      <description>Notes: Terms Exponential Functions: is a function that can be written in the form&amp;hellip; *f(x) = c * ax*; Where the number &amp;lsquo;c&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; are constants.
&amp;lsquo;c&amp;rsquo; is called the initial value (y-intercept). &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; is called the growth factor.
If a &amp;gt; 1; the function is growing. If a &amp;lt; 1; the function is decaying.  Growing: increasing by a FIXED percentage.
Decaying: decreasing by a FIXED percentage.</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms Definition of Logarithm: A logarithm can be defined as an exponent.
 loga(b) = c means the same as ac = b
 &amp;ldquo;loga(b) is the power to which we raise &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; to get &amp;lsquo;b&amp;rsquo;.&amp;ldquo;   Natural Logarithms: These are logarithms with base &amp;lsquo;e&amp;rsquo; (Euler&amp;rsquo;s Number).
 loge(x) is abbreviated ln(x).
 &amp;ldquo;ln(x) is the power to which we raise &amp;lsquo;e&amp;rsquo; (Euler&amp;rsquo;s number) to get &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;   Common Logarithms: These are logarithms with base 10.</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms The Product Rule:
*loga(x * y) = loga(x) + loga(y)*
 It&amp;rsquo;s just a rewritten form of:  *ar * as = ar + s*  The Quotient Rule:
loga(x / y) = loga(x) - loga(y)
 It&amp;rsquo;s just a rewritten form of:  ar / as = ar - s  The Power Rule:
*loga(xc) = C * loga(x)*
 It&amp;rsquo;s just a rewritten form of:  *(ar)s = ar * s*  Theorems/Formulas The Change of Base Formula:  logab = ln(b) / ln(a) = log(b) / log(a)</description>

      <description>Notes: Theorems/Formulas Remember the Compound Interest Formula? (It&amp;rsquo;s alright if you didn&amp;rsquo;t, for now&amp;hellip;)
Here it is:
A = P(1 + (r/n))nt
Where&amp;hellip;
P =&amp;gt; Principal
r =&amp;gt; annual interest rate (as a decimal)
n =&amp;gt; number of compoundings in a year
t =&amp;gt; time in years
A =&amp;gt; accumulated value
Now, there&amp;rsquo;s a formula for Continuously Compounded Interest.
This means roughly that interest is compunded infinitely many times per year.</description>

      <description>Notes: This section was mostly just example problems. I will probably not add those problems onto this site here but rather instead, have them onto my Random Math equation generator. If I ever get that created, then I will post the link here.
If you&amp;rsquo;re seeing this message, I have been lazy and probably forgot about the project. Shoot me a message about it if you want on my Github or LinkedIn.</description>
