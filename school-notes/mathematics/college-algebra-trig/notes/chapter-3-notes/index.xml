      <description>Notes: Terms Polynomial function(s): a polynomial function of degree n is a function of the form&amp;hellip;  P(x) = a(n)x(n) + a(n-1)x(n-1) + &amp;hellip; + a1x + a0  where n is a nonnegative integer and an =/= 0
Leading Term: of a polynomial is the term with the highest exponent.
Zeros of a polynomial: P(x) are numbers c, such that P&amp;copy; = 0 - &amp;ldquo;x coordinates of the x-intercepts.</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms P(x): Polynomial function.
D(x): - The Divider (What you used to divide the polynomial function). &amp;ldquo;D is for Divider&amp;rdquo;.
R(x): - The Reminder (Quantity that is left over after the division operation).
Other Things To Remember:  The two ways to write a Deperessed Polynomial :
*P(x) = D(x)*Q(x)+R(x)*
OR
P(x)/D(x) = Q(x) + R(x)/D(x)
  Ways to divide Polynomials  Long division  OR
 Synthetic division  Theorems The Remainder Theorem: If a polynomial P(x) is divided by (x-c), then the remainder &amp;reg; is P&amp;copy;.</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms Rational Suspects: The factors we&amp;rsquo;ve found based on the polynomial function.
Real-Number Zero: A number that when plugged into the polynomial function; Returns 0 in the remainder.
Example Problem to reinforce the idea Suppose that x = (5&amp;frasl;3) is a zero of a polynomial function that has INTEGER coefficients. What does that mean about a factor of the polynomial?
x = (5/3)
can also be&amp;hellip;
5x = 3</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms Complex Numbers: i = √-1;  A complex number is a number of the form a + bi;  Where &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;b&amp;rsquo; are real numbers and i = √-1.
Extras How many times would the graph of the function f(x) = 2x2 - x + 5 cross the x-axis?
Answer:  The graph wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cross the x-axis, since intercepts are Real-Number Zeros and this function has no real number zeros.</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms Theorems Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:  Every Polynomial function has at least one complex number zero.
The Zeros Theorem:  A Polynomial function of degree &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; has exactly &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; zeros, provided that a zero of multiplicity &amp;lsquo;k&amp;rsquo; is counted &amp;lsquo;k&amp;rsquo; times.
Complex Zeros of polynomials with Real Numbers:
Let f(x) be a polynomial with real number coefficients { If &#39;a+bi&#39; is a zero of f(x), then a-bi is also a zero of f(x).</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms Rational Function is a function of the form:  R(x) = n(x)/d(x)  where n(x) and d(x) are polynomials.
Domain: Input &amp;lsquo;range&amp;rsquo; of x.
Range: Output &amp;lsquo;range&amp;rsquo; of y.
Y-axis: &amp;ldquo;Vertical Asymptote&amp;rdquo;
 Vertical Asymptote:  A Vertical Asymptote for a rational function is a line x=k;  Where &amp;lsquo;k&amp;rsquo; is a zero of the denominator of the function.  Example:
f(x) = (2x+5)/(x-2)  When x is close to 2, x-2 is close to 0, so dividing by a very small number, which gives us large numbers.</description>
