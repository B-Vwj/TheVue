      <description>Notes: An angle in &amp;lsquo;standard&amp;rsquo; position has its initial side on the positive x-axis and vertex at the origin point, (0,0).
Converting between degrees and radians: If the units of an angle is not specified, they&amp;rsquo;re assumed to be in radians.
 π radians = 180˚
 (π / 2) = 90˚
 (π / 3) = 60˚
 (π / 4) = 45˚
 (π / 6) = 30˚</description>

      <description>Notes: Remember SOHCAHTOA? - Sine with Opposite length OVER the Hypotenuse
 Cosine with Adjacent length OVER the Hypotenuse  and finally,
 Tangent with Opposite length OVER the Adjacent length  Don&amp;rsquo;t forget their inverses as well…
 Cosecant with Hypotenuse OVER the Opposite length
 Secant with Hypotenuse OVER the Adjacent length
  and finally,
 Cotangent with Adjacent length OVER the Opposite length  Well… the Pythagorean Theorem applies!</description>

      <description>Notes: &amp;ldquo;Semantic memory&amp;rdquo; = facts
&amp;ldquo;Episodic memory&amp;rdquo; = stories, visualization
&amp;ldquo;Complimentary Sine&amp;rdquo; = Cosine
All of our Identities still work!
Standard Identities:  tan(ø) = sin(ø) / cos(ø)
 tan(ø) = 1 / cot(ø)
 cot(ø) = cos(ø) / sin(ø)
 sec(ø) = 1 / cos(ø)
 csc(ø) = 1 / sin(ø)
  Cofunction Identities:  cos(ø) = sin((π / 2) - ø)
 cot(ø) = tan((π / 2) - ø)</description>

      <title>Law of Sines</title>

      <description>The Law of Sines Draw a triangle; Then, divide the triangle into two right triangles. That line is h (stands for height).
We often label the angles in capital letters such as: A, B, and C.
The sides that is opposite of the angle is often labeled with the same letter but lower cased, such as: a, b, c.
Formula sin&amp;copy; = h/a =&amp;gt; (a)*sin&amp;copy; = h;
sin(A) = h/c =&amp;gt; &amp;copy;*sin(A) = h;</description>

      <description>The Law of Cosines The Law of Cosine can be used to solve triangles in 2 circumstances: - Given all 3 sides (SSS) - Given 2 sides and the included angle (SAS)
Example Given this triangle: [ Insert Screenshot image of triangle ]
With the triangle above, the coordinates of B are the hardest to find. We can find it with the formulas:
cos(A) = x/c = &amp;copy;cos(A) = x;</description>
