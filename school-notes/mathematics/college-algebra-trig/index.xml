      <description>Notes: Terms Polynomial function(s): a polynomial function of degree n is a function of the form&amp;hellip;  P(x) = a(n)x(n) + a(n-1)x(n-1) + &amp;hellip; + a1x + a0  where n is a nonnegative integer and an =/= 0
Leading Term: of a polynomial is the term with the highest exponent.
Zeros of a polynomial: P(x) are numbers c, such that P&amp;copy; = 0 - &amp;ldquo;x coordinates of the x-intercepts.</description>
