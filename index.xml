      <title>CSS Tips</title>

      <description>Sticky Footer for Your Website!  Footer at the bottom of page: For your HTML use&amp;hellip;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;page-container&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;content-wrap&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- all other page content --&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;footer id=&amp;quot;footer&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;   For CSS an example to use is&amp;hellip;
#page-container { position: relative; min-height: 100vh; } #content-wrap { padding-bottom: 2.5rem; /* Footer height */ } #footer { position: absolute; bottom: 0; width: 100%; height: 2.5rem; /* Footer height */ }  The page-container id tag covers the whole page (header, content, and footer), while the content-wrap id tag covers only the content (and possibly the header if you want to include it) while leaving the footer out so that you can position it in its absolute position to the bottom, hence:  bottom: 0;</description>

Converting between degrees and radians: If the units of an angle is not specified, they&amp;rsquo;re assumed to be in radians.
 π radians = 180˚
 (π / 2) = 90˚
 (π / 3) = 60˚
 (π / 4) = 45˚

      <title>CSS Cascade</title>
      <link>https://b-vwj.github.io/TheVue/programming/web-dev/css/css-in-depth/the-cascade/cascade/</link>

      <guid>https://b-vwj.github.io/TheVue/programming/web-dev/css/css-in-depth/the-cascade/cascade/</guid>
      <description>The Cascade Fundamentally, CSS is about declaring rules: Under various conditions, we want certain things to happen.
When declarations conflict, the cascade considers three things to resolve the difference: 1. Stylesheet Origin - Where the styles come from. Your styles are applied in conjunction with the browser’s default styles. 2. Selector Specificity - Which selectors take precedence over which. 3. Source Order - Order in which styles are declared in the stylesheet.</description>

      <title>CSS Specificity</title>

      <guid>https://b-vwj.github.io/TheVue/programming/web-dev/css/css-in-depth/the-cascade/specificity/</guid>
      <description>Understand Specificity Understanding Specificity is essential. You can go a long way without an understanding of stylesheet origin because 99% of the styles on your website come from the same origin. But if you don’t understand specificity, it’ll come back to bite you.
Inline Styles If you use an HTML style attribute to apply styles, the declarations are applied only to that element. - These are, in effect, “scoped” declarations, which override any declarations applied from your stylesheet or a &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; tag.</description>

      <description>Terminology of CSS Take this code as an example. This is called a declaration. This declaration is made up of a property (color) and a value (black):
color: black;  Properties aren’t to be confused with attributes , which are part of the HTML syntax. For example, in the element &amp;lt;a href=“#”&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, href is an attribute of the a tag.
A group of declarations inside curly braces is called a declaration block.</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms Exponential Functions: is a function that can be written in the form&amp;hellip; *f(x) = c * ax*; Where the number &amp;lsquo;c&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; are constants.
&amp;lsquo;c&amp;rsquo; is called the initial value (y-intercept). &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; is called the growth factor.
If a &amp;gt; 1; the function is growing. If a &amp;lt; 1; the function is decaying.  Growing: increasing by a FIXED percentage.
Decaying: decreasing by a FIXED percentage.</description>

What is the circumference of the unit circle?
Circumference of a circle of radius &amp;lsquo;r&amp;rsquo; is 2πr.
Terms trigon: Greek for &amp;lsquo;triangle&amp;rsquo;.
metry (metric?): Greek for &amp;lsquo;measure&amp;rsquo;.
terminal point: The terminal point on the unit circle determined by the real number t.
To further explain terminal point, imagine that you&amp;rsquo;re standing on top of point (1,0) on the unit circle (the far right of the circle).</description>

      <description>Understanding Stylesheet Origin The Stylesheets you add to your web page aren’t the only ones the browser applies. There are different types, or origins, of stylesheets. Yours are called authors stylesheets; There are also user agent styles, which are the browser’s default styles. - Use agent styles have lower priority, so your styles override them. - Some browsers let users define a user stylesheet. User stylesheets are rarely used and beyond your control, so I’ve left them out for simplicity.</description>

Other Things To Remember:  The two ways to write a Deperessed Polynomial :
*P(x) = D(x)*Q(x)+R(x)*
OR
P(x)/D(x) = Q(x) + R(x)/D(x)
  Ways to divide Polynomials  Long division  OR

      <description>Maven &amp;ldquo;When building our Spring Application, we need to manage our dependencies.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;We need to import the &amp;lsquo;Jar&amp;rsquo;s that is required for Spring Applications to work.&amp;rdquo;
 Usually in Java, you&amp;rsquo;d take the JARs and add it to the CLASSPATH  We won&amp;rsquo;t do this. We&amp;rsquo;ll use Maven instead!   What is Maven? Maven: Build Independency Management Tool
Lets you declare all the dependencies you want in a single file.</description>

      <description>There’s one last way that an element can receive styles - inheritance. The cascade is frequently conflated with the concept on inheritance. Although the two topics are related, you should understand each individually.
If an element has no cascaded value for a given property, it may inherit one from an ancestor element. It’s common to apply a font-family to the &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; element. All the ancestor elements within will then inherit this font; you don’t have to apply it explicitly to each element on the page.</description>

(Function)Constructors
Var Person = function(name, yearOfBirth, Job) { this.name; this.yearOfBirth; this.job }
Inheritance - Add all methods and properties into the constructor’s prototype property.
Constructor: Person
We’re adding the method:
this.calcAge = func() { console.log(2020 - this.yearOfBirth) }  To the person constructor, and now, it is inherited by all objects. Example:</description>

      <description>Notes: If you look at the Unit Circle, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it starts at point (0,0), and then it ends after a period of 2π.
So a usual graph would begin at (0,0) and end at 2π. However, not all graphs do this.
A trigonometric graph would usually look like this:
f(x) = (a)sin(bx - c)
So&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s nice to know and all, but what things do we look for in a trigonometric graph?</description>

Extras How many times would the graph of the function f(x) = 2x2 - x + 5 cross the x-axis?
Answer:  The graph wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cross the x-axis, since intercepts are Real-Number Zeros and this function has no real number zeros.</description>

      <description>Notes: Theorems/Formulas Remember the Compound Interest Formula? (It&amp;rsquo;s alright if you didn&amp;rsquo;t, for now&amp;hellip;)
Here it is:
A = P(1 + (r/n))nt
Where&amp;hellip;
P =&amp;gt; Principal
r =&amp;gt; annual interest rate (as a decimal)
n =&amp;gt; number of compoundings in a year
t =&amp;gt; time in years
A =&amp;gt; accumulated value
Now, there&amp;rsquo;s a formula for Continuously Compounded Interest.
This means roughly that interest is compunded infinitely many times per year.</description>

 Inverse functions are one-to-one functions: f(x) and g(x) such that… f(g(x)) = x and g(f(x)) = x  Remember which functions had inverse functions?
 Only one-to-one functions have inverse functions. Remember that these are functions that pass the horizontal line test.  To define the inverse function of f(x) = sin(x), we pretty clear have a problem… The function fails the horizontal line test spectacularly!</description>

Apply:  The apply() method is used to write methods, which can be used on different objects. It is different from the function call() because it takes arguments as an array.  Bind:  Similar to call. Lets us set the ‘this’ variable explicitly. “Bind doesn’t immediately call the function, but generates a copy of the function so that we can store it somewhere” Bind method returns a function.</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms Rational Function is a function of the form:  R(x) = n(x)/d(x)  where n(x) and d(x) are polynomials.
Domain: Input &amp;lsquo;range&amp;rsquo; of x.
Range: Output &amp;lsquo;range&amp;rsquo; of y.
Y-axis: &amp;ldquo;Vertical Asymptote&amp;rdquo;
 Vertical Asymptote:  A Vertical Asymptote for a rational function is a line x=k;  Where &amp;lsquo;k&amp;rsquo; is a zero of the denominator of the function.  Example:
f(x) = (2x+5)/(x-2)  When x is close to 2, x-2 is close to 0, so dividing by a very small number, which gives us large numbers.</description>
