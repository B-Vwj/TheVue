## **Spring Boot Documentation**

---

### What is ***Spring Boot***?

Spring Boot is the "Spring framework" application that is coupled with "Bootstrap". Allowing the user to Bootstrap the Spring Application.

Official definition: "Spring Boot makes it easy to create ***stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can 'just run***'."

#### Key Take Aways...

- Creating Spring Based Applications (from Spring Boot).
- Stand-Alone (Runs on its own).
- Production grade (deployable to prod).
- 'just runnable'.
- Easy way to get things working!

### What is ***Spring***

- ***2006 definition:***
  - Dependency Injections
- ***Up-to-date definition:***
  - Application Framework ("Lets you build Enterprise Java Applications")
    - Enterprise Java Applications(EJA) have many similarities
    - Spring provides a template/framework to build those EJA
  - Programming and Configuration Model
  - Infrastructure Support

#### Some Problems with ***Spring***

- It's a **HUGE** framework
  - So many ways to build EJAs; Spring has tried to support it all. (How to get started...?)
- Multiple Setup Steps
- Multiple Configuration Steps
- Multiple Build and Deploy Steps (lots of capability and flexibility, so... no main pathways are set.)

### Enter ***Spring Boot***

- Opinionated (start "here", then move on if needed)
- Convention Over Configuration
- Stand Alone Application (SAA; Not Side, Angle, Angle lol)
- Production Ready!

Tools Used:
- Spring Tool Suite(STS) (looks like eclipse).
- **At least** Java 8 SDK.
