## Bind, Call, and Apply in JS

### Call:
- Set the ‘this’ variable to another object.
- Borrow a method from another object.

### Apply:
- The apply() method is used to write methods, which can be used on different objects. It is different from the function call() because it takes arguments as an array.

### Bind:
- Similar to call.
- Lets us set the ‘this’ variable explicitly.
- “Bind doesn’t immediately call the function, but generates a copy of the function so that we can store it somewhere”
- Bind method returns a function.
