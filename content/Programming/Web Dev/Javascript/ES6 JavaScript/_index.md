### Extra Stuff (probably just regurgitating information)
- Language Basics
    - Variables and Strings (store state and values as the programs run)
    - Operators (modify values of variables and strings)
    - Arrays (Lists of multiple values in a single variable)
    - Functions, parameters, and return values (blocks of code that can be executed when and where we want; they can take inputs as parameters and return outputs thru return values)
    - If statements (test conditions; choose whether or not to run code; variants such as “else if” and “else”)
    - While and For loops (these are ways to execute code multiple times and provide some sort of automation)
    - Break, continue, and return statements (provided control)
    - Classes and objects (objects are code entities with state and behavior; classes are blueprints for objects, and they’re syntactic sugar)
