Tests: <br/>
You will be testing at home.
I will post the test on D2L and attach it to an email.
If you have a printer at home you can print the test and work it as you would in class.  
Then you can send me what you have done by either
scanning or email.
I will be grading you on the completeness, correctness, and clarity of your work and I’ll be a bit merciless about this.
You’ll get your first test on March 23 and it will be due on March 30.
If you don’t have a printer you can just write the problems on separate paper and send those to me.

Homework: <br/>
I don’t think I’m going to be able to look at all of the homework.  
I can’t think of a good way to get it from you.  I will just make extra sure that the tests reflect the homework.

Lecture: <br/>
Our regular classroom is a classroom-capture room.
That means there is a camera in the room that will record everything that happens there.
I’ve asked that the camera be turned on so that you can access the recordings of those lecture whenever you want. I’ll be lecturing to an empty classroom, which will be thrilling for me, but you’ll be able to see it from home.  There will be a link in D2L to get to the recording.  I’ll keep doing that as long as I can have access to the room.  If at some point I no longer have access, I will replace these lectures with some YouTube videos that I will make as well as lots of written explanations of what we are doing.

Group-work: <br/>
Of course you’re not going to be able to work in groups and still maintain social distancing.  I will, however, ask you to do some work in groups of one (that’s by yourself) and send that to me.

There will be more information coming soon.  Stay tuned.  If you have any questions at all you can email me as often as you like.
