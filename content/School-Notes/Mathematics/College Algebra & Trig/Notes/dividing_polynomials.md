## _Notes:_

### Terms

P(x) - Polynomial function.

D(x) - The Divider (What you used to divide the polynomial function). "D is for Divider".

R(x) - The Reminder (Quantity that is left over after the division operation).

---

### Other Things To Remember:

- The two ways to write a ***Deperessed Polynomial*** :

    ***P(x) = D(x)*Q(x)+R(x)***

    OR

    ***P(x)/D(x) = Q(x) + R(x)/D(x)***

Example Problem:

_Divide the polynomial **P(x) = x<sup>4</sup> + 3x<sup>3</sup> - 5x<sup>2</sup> + 2x - 8** by the polynomial **D(x) = x + 2.** Write the answer in the form **P(x) = D(x)*Q(x)+R(x)** and also in the form **P(x)/D(x) = Q(x) + R(x)/D(x).**_

Long-Division: <br/>
(quotient) **x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> - 7x + 16**<br/>
**x + 2 | P(x) = x<sup>4</sup> + 3x<sup>3</sup> - 5x<sup>2</sup> + 2x - 8**
