## _Notes:_

### Terms

***P(x):*** Polynomial function.

***D(x):*** - The Divider (What you used to divide the polynomial function). "D is for Divider".

***R(x):*** - The Reminder (Quantity that is left over after the division operation).

---

### Other Things To Remember:

- The two ways to write a ***Deperessed Polynomial*** :

    ***P(x) = D(x)*Q(x)+R(x)***

    OR

    ***P(x)/D(x) = Q(x) + R(x)/D(x)***

---

### Ways to divide Polynomials

1. Long division

  OR

1. Synthetic division

### Theorems

#### The Remainder Theorem:
If a polynomial P(x) is divided by (x-c), then the ***remainder (r)*** is P(c).

Proof:
```
P(x) = Q(x)(x-c) + r
P(c) = Q(c)(c-c) + r
P(c) = Q(c)(0) + r
P(c) = r
```
We can essentially rewrite `P(x) = Q(x)(x-c) + r` to `P(x) = Q(x)(x-c) + P(c)`


#### The Factor Theorem:
If P(x) is a polynomial and P(c) = 0; Then (x-c) is a factor of P(x).
- That is... P(x) = Q(x)(x-c)
