## _Notes:_

### Terms

***Rational Suspects:*** The factors we've found based on the polynomial function.

***Real-Number Zero:*** A number that when plugged into the polynomial function; Returns 0 in the remainder.

### Example Problem to reinforce the idea

Suppose that x = (5/3) is a zero of a polynomial function that has INTEGER coefficients. What does that mean about a factor of the polynomial?

`x = (5/3)`

can also be...

`5x = 3`

Or even...

`5x - 3 = 0`

Hence... 5x-3 is a factor of the polynomial!

So for... `P(x) = (5x-3)Q(x)`,
- Leading term of P(x) is **5x**.
  - The leading coefficient of P(x) is a multiple of 5.

- Constant term of P(x) is **-3**.
  - The constant term of P(x) is a multiple of 3.

### Theorems

```
Let P(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients {

  Where 'a' is a factor of the '**Constant Term**', and 'b' is a factor of the '**Leading Coefficient**' of P(x) {

  Any rational number zeros of P(x) are of the form: `x = (a/b)`;

  }

}
```
