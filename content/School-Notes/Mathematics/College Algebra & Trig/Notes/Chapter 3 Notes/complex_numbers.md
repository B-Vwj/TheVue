## _Notes:_

### Terms

***Complex Numbers:*** `i = √-1`; <br/> A complex number is a number of the form `a + bi`; <br/> Where 'a' and 'b' are real numbers and `i = √-1`.

### Extras

How many times would the graph of the function ***f(x) = 2x<sup>2</sup> - x + 5*** cross the x-axis?

Answer: <br/> The graph wouldn't cross the x-axis, since intercepts are **Real-Number Zeros** and ***this function has no real number zeros***.
