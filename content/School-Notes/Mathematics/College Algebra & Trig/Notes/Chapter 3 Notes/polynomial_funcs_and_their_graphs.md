## _Notes:_

### Terms

***Polynomial function(s):*** a polynomial function of degree ***n*** is a function of the form... <br/> ***P(x) = a<sub>(n)</sub>x<sup>(n)</sup> + a<sub>(n-1)</sub>x<sup>(n-1)</sup> + ... + a<sub>1</sub>x + a<sub>0</sub>*** <br/> where ***n*** is a nonnegative integer and a<sub>n</sub> =/= 0

***Leading Term:*** of a polynomial is the term with the highest exponent.

***Zeros of a polynomial:*** P(x) are numbers c, such that P(c) = 0
- "x coordinates of the x-intercepts."

***The end behavior of a polynomial:*** For the graph of _any_ polynomial function, the ends will either point up or down. For example:

```
As x -> ∞; f(x) (will either) -> ∞ OR -∞
As x -> -∞; f(x) (will either) -> ∞ OR -∞
```

`Odd Degree & Positive Leading Coefficient: Left down & Right up.`

`Even Degree & Positive Leading Coefficient: Both ends up.`

`Odd Degree & Negative Leading Coefficient: Left up & Right Down.`

`Even Degree & Negative Leading Coefficient: Both ends down.`

### Other Things To Remember:

- The numbers ***a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>(n)</sub>*** <br/> are called _**coefficients**_ of the Polynomial.

- ***a<sub>0</sub>*** is the ***constant coefficient*** or ***constant term***.

- The number ***a<sub>(n)</sub>***, the coefficient of the highest power, is the ***leading coefficient***, and the term ***a<sub>(x)</sub>x<sup>(n)</sup>*** is the ***leading term***.

#### Names of certain degrees

- If a polynomial consists of just a single term, then it's called a ***monomial***.
For example: <br/> ***P(x) = x<sup>3</sup>*** and ***Q(x) = -6x<sup>5</sup>*** are monomials.

- ***f(x) = a<sub>(1)</sub>x +/- a<sub>0</sub>*** is considered a "***Linear***" equation.

- ***f(x) = a<sub>(2)</sub>x<sup>2</sup> +/- a<sub>(1)</sub>x +/- a<sub>0</sub>*** is considered a "***Quadratic***" equation.

- ***f(x) = a<sub>(3)</sub>x<sup>3</sup> + a<sub>(2)</sub>x<sup>2</sup> + a<sub>(1)</sub>x + a<sub>0</sub>*** is considered a "***Cubic***" equation.

#### Exponents affect the graph!

Even exponent:
- Parabola
- Bigger exponent means flatter base (near zero)(?)
Odd exponent:
- Zig-Zag(?)
- Bigger exponent means flatter base (near zero)(?)
