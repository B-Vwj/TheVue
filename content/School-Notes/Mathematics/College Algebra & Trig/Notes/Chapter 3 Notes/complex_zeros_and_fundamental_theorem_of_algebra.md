### Terms



### Theorems

***Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:*** <br/> Every Polynomial function has at least one complex number zero.

***The Zeros Theorem:*** <br/> A Polynomial function of degree 'n' has exactly 'n' zeros, provided that a zero of multiplicity 'k' is counted 'k' times.

***Complex Zeros of polynomials with Real Numbers:***
```
Let f(x) be a polynomial with real number coefficients {
  If 'a+bi' is a zero of f(x), then a-bi is also a zero of f(x).
}
```

"Complex zeros happen in **conjugate pairs**."
