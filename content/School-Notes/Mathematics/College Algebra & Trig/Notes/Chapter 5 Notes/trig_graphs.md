## _Notes:_

If you look at the Unit Circle, you'll see that it starts at point (0,0), and then it ends after a period of 2π.

So a usual graph would begin at (0,0) and end at 2π. However, not all graphs do this.

A trigonometric graph would usually look like this:

**f(x) = (a)sin(bx - c)**

So... that's nice to know and all, but what things do we look for in a trigonometric graph?

- Domain

- Range

- Period

- Odd or Even function

And… if the question demands it…

- Amplitude

- Phase Shift

### Terms

- **Amplitude: 'a' (going up & down)**

- **Period: (2π / b)**

  - Proof: bx - c = 2π => x = (2π + c / b)


- **Phase shift: (c / b)**

  - Proof: bx - c = 0 => x = (c / b)
