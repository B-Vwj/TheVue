## _Notes:_

An angle in 'standard' position has its initial side on the positive x-axis and vertex at the origin point, (0,0).

Converting between degrees and radians:
If the units of an angle is not specified, they're assumed to be in **radians**.

- **π radians = 180˚**

- **(π / 2) = 90˚**

- **(π / 3) = 60˚**

- **(π / 4) = 45˚**

- **(π / 6) = 30˚**

### Formulas / Terms

Angles:

- **Radian Measure**: The radian measure of an angle is the length of the arc on the Unit Circle subtended (cut off) by the angle.

- **Degree Measure**:
  - **360˚ is a complete revolution**
  - **180˚ is a straight angle**
  - **90˚ is a right angle**
  - 0˚ ≤ Angles ≤ 90˚ are called **acute** angles
  - 90˚ < Angles are called **obtuse** angles.

**Coterminal Angles**: Angles in 'standard' position that have the same 'initial side' as well as the same 'terminal side' are called 'Coterminal angles'.

Example:

```
Find four angles that are coterminal with the angle ø = 160˚.

160˚ + 360˚ = 520˚
160˚ + 2(360˚) = 880˚
160˚ - 360˚ = -200˚
160˚ - 2(360˚) = -560˚
```

To find the length of a circular arc inside of a circle, you can use two equations:

- **S = (t / 2π)(2π * r)**

  - First part of the equation (t / 2π): Fraction of whole circle.

  - Second part of the equation (2π * r): Whole circumference.

- **S = t * r**

  - **Note**: This equation only applies if '_t_' is in radians.

To find the area of a sector use the formula:

- **A = (1 / 2)tr<sup>2</sup>**
