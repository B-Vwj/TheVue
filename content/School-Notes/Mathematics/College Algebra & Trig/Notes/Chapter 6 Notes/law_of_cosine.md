## The Law of Cosines

The Law of Cosine can be used to solve triangles in 2 circumstances:
- Given all 3 sides (SSS)
- Given 2 sides and the included angle (SAS)

### Example

Given this triangle:  [ Insert Screenshot image of triangle ]

With the triangle above, the coordinates of B are the hardest to find. We can find it with the formulas:

***cos(A) = x/c*** = ***(c)cos(A) = x***;

***sin(A) = h/c*** = ***(c)sin(A) = h***;

Those both would be plotted as: **(_(c)cos(A)_, _(c)sin(A)_)**.

We also will need the distance formula for finding the distance between points (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>).

### Formula

“***cos(A) = x/c*** = ***(c)cos(A) = x***;

***sin(A) = h/c*** = ***(c)sin(A) = h***;

Those both would be plotted as: **(_(c)cos(A)_, _(c)sin(A)_)**”

**Distance Formula**:
d = sqrt((x<sub>2</sub>-x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)

This would be converted into ***The Law of Cosine*** through:

**Laws of Cosine**:
- a<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - 2 * b * c * cos(A)
- b<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - 2 * a * c * cos(B)
- c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2 * a * b * cos(C)
