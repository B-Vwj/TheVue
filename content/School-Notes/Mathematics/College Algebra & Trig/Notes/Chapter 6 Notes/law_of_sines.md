## The Law of Sines

Draw a triangle; Then, divide the triangle into two **right** triangles. That line is _h_ (stands for height).

We often label the angles in capital letters such as: _A_, _B_, and _C_.

The sides that is opposite of the angle is often labeled with the same letter but lower cased, such as: _a_, _b_, _c_.

### Formula

***sin(C) = h/a*** => ***(a)\*sin(C) = h***;

***sin(A) = h/c*** => ***(c)\*sin(A) = h***;

So, ***(a)\*sin(C) = (c)\*sin(A)***; Or better yet, ***a/sin(A) = c/sin(C)***.

We can also do ***a/sin(A) = b/sin(B)***.

Bring this together we get:

```
a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)

And

sin(A)/a = sin(B)/b = sin(C)/c
```
