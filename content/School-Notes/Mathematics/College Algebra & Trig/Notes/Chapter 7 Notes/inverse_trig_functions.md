## _Notes:_

Remember inverse functions?

- Inverse functions are one-to-one functions: f(x) and g(x) such that… **f(g(x)) = x and g(f(x)) = x**

Remember which functions had inverse functions?

- Only one-to-one functions have inverse functions.
- Remember that these are functions that pass the horizontal line test.

To define the inverse function of f(x) = sin(x), we pretty clear have a problem… The function fails the horizontal line test spectacularly!

To define an inverse function for f(x) = sin(x), we’ll have to restrict the domain. So we restrict it down to [(-π / 2), (π / 2)].

Now, g(x) = sin<sup>-1</sup>(x) will be an angle between (-π / 2) and (π / 2).

But let us define the inverse function of f(x) = cos(x) now.

g(x) = cos<sup>-1</sup>(x) is an angle y between 0 and π such that cos(y) = x.

Basically:
- Cos<sup>-1</sup>(x) = y <===> cos(y) = x

Domain: [-1, 1]

Range: [0, π]

Other Stuff to Note:

- **g(x) = sin<sup>-1</sup>(x)** is also written as **g(x) = arcsin(x)**
