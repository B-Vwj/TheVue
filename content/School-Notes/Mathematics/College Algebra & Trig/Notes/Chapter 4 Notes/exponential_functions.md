## _Notes:_

### Terms

***Exponential Functions:*** <br> is a function that can be written in the form... ***f(x) = c * a<sup>x</sup>***; <br> Where the number 'c' and 'a' are constants.

'c' is called the initial value (y-intercept).
'a' is called the growth factor.

```
If a > 1; the function is growing.

If a < 1; the function is decaying.

```

***Growing:*** increasing by a FIXED percentage.

***Decaying:*** decreasing by a FIXED percentage.

***Natural Exponential Function:*** <br> is a function that can be written in the form... ***f(x) = e<sup>x</sup>***; <br> Where ***e ≈ 2.71828...***

- 'e' is called ***Euler's Number***.

### Sentences to Remember

"A positive (number) to the positive power is positive. Same can be said for a positive to the negative power."

### Formulas

***Compound Interest Formula:***

***A = P(1 + (r/n))<sup>nt</sup>***

Where...

***P => Principal.***

***r => annual interest rate (as a decimal).***

***n => number of compoundings in a year.***

***t => time in years.***

***A => accumulated value.***
