### Theorems/Formulas

Remember the ***Compound Interest Formula***? (It's alright if you didn't, for now...)

Here it is:

***A = P(1 + (r/n))<sup>nt</sup>***

Where...

***P => Principal***

***r => annual interest rate (as a decimal)***

***n => number of compoundings in a year***

***t => time in years***

***A => accumulated value***

Now, there's a formula for ***Continuously Compounded Interest***.

This means roughly that interest is compunded infinitely many times per year.

Here's the formula:

***A = Pe<sup>rt</sup>***

Where...

***P => Principal***

***A = accumulated value***

***r => annual interest rate***

***t => time in years***

***e = Euler's number***

We also have the ***Exponential Growth and Decay Model(s)***:

***n(t) = n<sub>(0)</sub>e<sup>rt</sup>***

Where...

***n => whatever is growing or decaying exponentially***

***r => relative growth rate (as a decimal)***

***t => time***

***n<sub>(0)</sub> => initial value of 'n' (value of 'n' corresponding to when t=0)***
