***Definition of Logarithm:*** A logarithm can be defined as an exponent.

- ***log<sub>a</sub>(b) = c*** means the same as ***a<sub>c</sub> = b***

  - "***log<sub>a</sub>(b)*** _is the power to which we raise **'a'** to get **'b'**._"

***Natural Logarithms:*** These are logarithms with base ***'e'*** (Euler's Number).

- ***log<sub>e</sub>(x)*** is abbreviated ***ln(x)***.

  - "***ln(x)*** is the power to which we raise 'e' (Euler's number) to get 'x'."
