## _Notes:_

### Terms

***Definition of Logarithm:*** A logarithm can be defined as an exponent.

- ***log<sub>a</sub>(b) = c*** means the same as ***a<sub>c</sub> = b***

  - "***log<sub>a</sub>(b)*** _is the power to which we raise **'a'** to get **'b'**._"

***Natural Logarithms:*** These are logarithms with base ***'e'*** (Euler's Number).

- ***log<sub>e</sub>(x)*** is abbreviated ***ln(x)***.

  - "***ln(x)*** is the power to which we raise 'e' (Euler's number) to get 'x'."

***Common Logarithms:*** These are logarithms with base 10.

- ***log<sub>10</sub>(x)*** is abbreviated ***log(x)***.

  - "***log(x)*** is the power to which we raise 10 to get x"

***Inverse Functions:*** "Whatever one of the function does, the other one undoes."

- Example: f(x)=log<sub>2</sub>x and g(x)=2<sup>x</sup> are **Inverse Functions**.

- f(g(x)) = a<sup>log<sub>a</sub>X</sup> = X
- g(f(x)) = log<sub>a</sub>a<sup>X</sup> = X

### Extra

**"0 cannot go into Logarithms!"**

***Richter Scale:***
Intensity of an earthquake is measured on the Richter Scale.

The formula:
***R = log(I/I<sub>0</sub>)***, where _I<sub>0</sub>_ is the intensity of the _"zero quake"_, the very tiny earthquake which all others are measured, and _I_ is the intensity of the quake being measured.
