## _Notes:_

This section was mostly just example problems. I will probably not add those problems onto this site here but rather instead, have them onto my Random Math equation generator. If I ever get that created, then I will post the link here.

If you're seeing this message, I have been lazy and probably forgot about the project. Shoot me a message about it if you want on my Github or LinkedIn.

### Extra Theorems and Notes

Newton's Law of Cooling:

***T = C + (T<sub>(0)</sub> - C)e<sup>kt</sup>***

Where...

***C => temperature of the surrounding medium***

***T<sub>(0)</sub> => Initial temperature (whatever is cooling)***

***T => Temperature of Coffee***

***t => time***
