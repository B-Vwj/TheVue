## Fundamentals of Public Speaking

### Notes:

Good questions to ask yourself:

1. How are you feeling today?
1. What are the causes for that feeling?
1. Why does that cause what you are feeling?

#### The Four Types of Speeches:
```
1. Manuscript (written out word for word)
  - Pros:
    - You know what you'll say;
    - Timing is perfect;
    - No eye contact;
  - Cons:
    - You'll sound robotic;
    - Losing your place is very bad;
    - No eye contact;
1. Memorized
  - Pros:
    - No reading/prompts;
    - Short speeches are easy;
    - There is eye-contact;
  - Cons:
    - You may forget, even WORSE;
    - Easy for filler words to slip in;
1. Impromptu (little to no preparation)
  - Pros:
    - Usually short speeches;
    - Emotion is involved;
    - No rehearsals;
    - Feels natural/conversational;
  - Cons:
    - Shy - anxiety;
    - Can get off-topic;
    - Lose track of time;
1. Extemporaneous (notes prepared; some memorized; little improvization mixed in)
  - Pros:
    - Connection to the topic;
    - Emotion is involved;
    - Time is perfect;
    - Know what you'll say easier;
    - There is eye-contact;
  - Cons:
    - More preparation needed;
    - More work to put in;
    - Must know your topic well;
