## Fundamentals of Public Speaking

### Notes:

Good questions to ask yourself:
1. How are you feeling today?
1. What are the causes for that feeling?
1. Why does that cause what you are feeling?

    1. Timing is perfect;
    1. No eye contact;

    1. You'll sound robotic;
    1. Losing your place is very bad;
    1. No eye contact;
1. Memorized

    1. Short speeches are easy;
    1. There is eye-contact;
